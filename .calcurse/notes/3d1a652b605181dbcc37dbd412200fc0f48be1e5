Attached, you will find the 2011 Student Council Election Packet, which includes an introductory letter, job descriptions for Executive Board members, election guidelines, the election timeline and the Executive Board application. All interested in participating in the 2011 Student Council Election must review the packet and read it in its entirety. Note that this election process is for the Executive Board (President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, Junior-At-Large and Senior-At-Large); Co-Chairs for Student Council's core committees will be appointed by the President-elect in May.

To run for Student Council President, one must be a rising senior, have a year of experience on Student Council (as a Student Council Representative, Hall Representative, Chairperson, All-Council member or Cabinet member). In addition, if you intend to run for President, you must indicate that on your application in advance. President applications will be reviewed in advance by the Student Council advisors and myself, to make certain all candidates have adequate experience and expertise to effectively serve as President. All other guidelines regarding the election are included in the 2011 Election Packet. 

To apply, submit applications to Shawon Jackson <sjackson@imsa.edu> by 11:59pm on Sunday, April 3rd.

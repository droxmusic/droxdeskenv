Ever wanted to help run the coolest club on campus?  Well, unfortunately, ping-pong club isn't taking applications, but SMAC is pretty far up there on the awesomeness scale!  As a SMAC board member, you can help run coffeehouses, raise money for wonderful charities, and show off the musical talent that runs through this school!  So, if you're interested, sign up for an interview next week (Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday) at midday.  It's a 10 minute slot and it's very informal, so don't worry about that.  Sign up right here:

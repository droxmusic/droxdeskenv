I know some of you all have been talking about this Cinco de Mayo event happening wednesday, and well if you haven't, there will be a Cinco de Mayo soccer game this Wednesday!
This Wednesday, we will be having a soccer match between Spanish speakers and other languages. It will take place at 11:30/12. If you would like to partake in this extravaganza, please reply to this email and let me know your name and whether you speak Spanish or a different language. 
BTW, if you are a native Spanish speaker but taking French, German etc. you will be on the SPANISH TEAM!

Keep it real,

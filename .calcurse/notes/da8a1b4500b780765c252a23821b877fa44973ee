A reminder that the 2011-2012 IS contracts are due to your CAC on Monday, August 22.  You can find a copy of an IS contract in Document Library on Family Connection.

You may take an IS for one or two semesters, by yourself or with a group of students.  However, each student must submit his/her own individual Independent Study contract.

Last one!

The end of the year is drawing closer and closer, and it is sad to announce that today will be our last General Assembly for the 2010-2011 school year. Come join StudCo as we talk about our year-end projects, and, as always, listen to any ideas you have so they may be pursued during the last month of school or the following school year. After today, the next General Assembly will be on May 19th, and President-Elect Aadi Tolappa will head that meeting. 

Our last meeting will be very short, as we want to support Take Back the Night, which is taking place tonight, too! :) So, come on out and enjoy the last GA of the year! =D

Are you intersted in being one of the first students to meet and welcome the Class of 2014?

The dates for Summer Orientation are June 24-25th and July 1-2nd.
Working as a guide is a tough job and a fun job all rolled up into one.

If you are unable to make the meeting, please talk to your peers to find out the information you missed at the meeting and stop by 1501 for an application.

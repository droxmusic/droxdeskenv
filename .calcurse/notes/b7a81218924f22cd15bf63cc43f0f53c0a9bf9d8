Hey IMSA People!

BELLAS and SCIA would like to present the 2011 Remarkable Women’s Luncheon. We invite you to come eat a catered lunch with some of the remarkable women on the IMSA campus & State Legislators.

To attend the lunch, just sign-up in Student Life with a dollar donation; all proceeds go to Mutual Ground Women’s Shelter. 

Thank You, 
Ashley Smith

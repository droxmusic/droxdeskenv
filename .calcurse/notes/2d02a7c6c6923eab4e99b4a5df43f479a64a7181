The time has now come to bring in a new team of LEAD Facilitators for next year! LEAD's goal is to inspire its sophomore students through open classroom discussion, engaging and meaningful activities, real life applications, and personal reflection so that they may become positive, ethical leaders who pursue their passions and utilize their individual capability to create the change they want to see in the world. As a facilitator, you will be expected to guide sophomores through the LEAD program and act as a role model inside and outside the classroom. The role requires much responsibility, a significant time commitment, great vision, and outstanding leadership capabilities.

Please fill out and submit the attached application by *SATURDAY, MAY 14th at 10:00 PM* to leadapps2011@gmail.com. Make sure to allow yourself enough time to write a thoughtful response to each of the questions.

It is strongly advised that you contact Grace Choi (gchoi1@imsa.edu, 224-520-3298), Stanley Yuan (syuan@imsa.edu, 630-301-4039), and/or Linsey Crowninshield (linseyc@imsa.edu) if you have any questions before you turn in this application.

Good luck with your applications!

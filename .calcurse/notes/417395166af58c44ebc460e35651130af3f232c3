Hey IMSA,

In the spirit of the upcoming holiday, and just to have some fun, Studco will be having an Easter Egg hunt April 19th. Find colored Easter eggs throughout the morning and bring them to the studco table during midday to exchange them for candy! 

Find Easter eggs and GET CANDY!!!

Happy hunting!!

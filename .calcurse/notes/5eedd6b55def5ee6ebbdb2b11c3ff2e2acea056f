You are invited to attend the Extreme Entrepreneurship Tour on April 6th from 3:00 - 7:00PM on the IIT main campus. This sounds like an exciting event, I will have a mini-bus that leaves IMSA at 2:00 and returns by 8:00ish.  Please let me know before midnight tonight if you want to come. I have room for 12 students (two have already signed-up). We have been invited by David Winkin , the Associate Director  of the Knapp Entrepreneurship Center.

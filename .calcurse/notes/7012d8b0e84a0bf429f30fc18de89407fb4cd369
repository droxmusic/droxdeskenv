"Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factors that Control Motor Neuron Vulnerability in ALS"

Even though there are millions of neurons in our brain, in neurodegenerative
diseases only a select set of neurons show vulnerability and progressively
degenerate. In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), motor neurons in the cortex and
spinal cord show selective vulnerability. Their progressive degeneration results in
lack of control over voluntary movement, without affecting memory and cognitive
function. We are developing novel approaches to understand cellular and molecular
mechanisms responsible for motor neuron degeneration. Our findings will allow
cell-based therapeutic interventions in the near future.

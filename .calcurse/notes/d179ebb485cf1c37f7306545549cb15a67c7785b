Hey Everybody,
Ever wish you could just run away and escape all of this craziness?  Well, if you think you have it bad, just be glad you aren't a slave in ancient Egypt like the Jews were!  Come and celebrate their miraculous exodus from Egypt with Hatikvah as we celebrate Passover with a seder!  A seder is a ritual meal where this amazing story is told, and, more importantly, we EAT!  So, come hungry!

When: Wednesday April 20 (next Wednesday), 8:00
Where: TV Pit
Why:  To celebrate this awesome holiday and chill out before your IMSAloquium!

Shalom,
Hatikvah

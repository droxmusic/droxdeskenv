Again, if you are looking forward to gain some exposure to the world outside IMSA and help those in dire need, then this is the place you should be at Thursday night. There will be free pizza for all who show up :)

UNICEF stands for United Nations International Childrenâ€™s Emergency Fund, and its mission is to reduce the number of children who die from preventable causes to zero.

Our group is focused on raising awareness about the under-privileged children around the world, as well as providing support via raising funds and donations, which will be sent to various areas around the world through UNICEF. We will be discussing more details of this new club, and hope to hear any suggestions that you guys have to offer.

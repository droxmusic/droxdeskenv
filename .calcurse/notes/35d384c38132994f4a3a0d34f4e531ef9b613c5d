Your very own AASA will be hosting a spades tournament Monday, May 16th. This competition is open to all staff, RC's and students who want to play.
If you're worried about not knowing how to play that's perfectly fine, we will also host a tutorial for those of you who are interested. 

We will also have a special prize for our winning team!
All you need is a partner to sign up! (If you don't have a partner but still want to participate sign up and we'll find you one.)

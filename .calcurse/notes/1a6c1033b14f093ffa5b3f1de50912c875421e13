Mandatory informational session on the Community Developer position.
If you are interested in being a Community Developer then stop by the meeting and get some important information on what it takes to be a Community Developer!

Each hall, each year, hires TWO Community Developers (or CDs) to help organize hall programming for the school year. These students should possess excellent leadership skills and be willing to network throughout the entire hall that they will be living in next year.

So, If you are interested in being a Community Developer next year then you must attend the meeting on Tuesday night (attendance will be taken).
If you are interested in a Wing Guide role then we will be holding a separate information session for those interested on April 12th (more to come soon).

The hiring process for Residential Student Leaders is unique in that we make CD placements BEFORE the housing selection process, Wing Guides will be hired after housing is done. That way you may apply for both positions if you desire. 

We want your leadership, we need your leadership. Anyone interested in being a Community Developer or just learning more to what it takes to be one should be in the Lecture Hall at 9:30pm on March 22nd.

See you then!

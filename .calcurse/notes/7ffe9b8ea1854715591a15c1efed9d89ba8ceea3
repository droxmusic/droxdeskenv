Hello IMSA People.

Student Council will be collecting test preparatory books such as AP, SAT, and ACT books from IMSA students who are finished with them and would like to help other test-takers, while making a profit. How it will work, during midday in the Old Cafe as of Tuesday, April 12, 2011, student council members will be collecting books. All books collected will note the sellers name and condition of the books. Tentatively if the condition of the book is new 5% will be taken off of the retail price, while used books will be sold 10% off. All of the profit made from each book sold, will be returned to the original owner. Student Council members will also be set up in the old cafe during midday Thursday, April 14, 2011 and Friday, April 15, 2011. A special thanks goes to Jon Munoz for proposing this idea to student council. 

Thanks, 
Studco

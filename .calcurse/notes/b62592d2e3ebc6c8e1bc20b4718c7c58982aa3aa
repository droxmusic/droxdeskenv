After your RC poured his/her heart and soul into your hall for Clash of the Halls, don't you want to return the love?
Of course you do! And that's why you should nominate your RC for April's RC Spotlight!

Every month one RC will be chosen by YOU for their amazing contributions to our IMSA community. Your RC will get a night shift off that will be covered by our very own DR. MAX MCGEE! So if you love your RC (or just love Dr. McGee), please write a brief (100 word) paragraph outlining how your RC has demonstrated this IMSA Belief statement:

*Trust and respect are vital for any relationship to thrive*

Things to consider in your paragraph:

   - Activities, wing or other, this RC has planned
   - How he/she has paid attention to the needs of the community members
   - If he/she has severed on committees or as a sponsor for Academy activities
   - How he/she correctly manages residential policies and life
   - Any student sport games and/or club activities he/she has attended
   - Driving trips he/she has taken

E-mail your 100 word paragraph to yaktan@imsa.edu *by Monday April 4th!*

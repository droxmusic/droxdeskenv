Tonight, StudCo will be hosting its last set of committee meetings! Thank you all for such an amazing year - your contribution, support, and ideas have led to our success this past year! 

So, come out to one of our meetings tonight and celebrate an amazing year! =) 

Academic - 1506

I personally would like to thank all of my phenomenal co-chairs - Holly Hernandez and Ashley Smith (Academic), Hannah Miller and Cassie Parks (Communications), and Yusuf Aktan and Ruchi Aggarwal (Residential Life) - for their extraordinary work this year! :) 

Have a wonderful Monday, everyone, and hope to see you around tonight!

Best wishes,

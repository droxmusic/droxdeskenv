It is time for you to ask yourselves a very important question:  Have you ever wanted to be a BELLA (Beautiful Empowered Lady Leading All)?

BELLAs is dedicated to female empowerment and spreading awareness for many issues that plague women in our community and around the world. Some programs that we have organized this year are: Gossip Girls, Tales from the Homefront, BELLAs Post Secret (If You Really Knew Me) and a movie discussion night (America the Beautiful). Some upcoming events we have are the Remarkable Women’s Luncheon and the Sexual Violence Awareness Week which includes Take Back the Night.

It you are interested in planning and running events for the entire IMSA community and are passionate about female empowerment, consider applying.  This group is open to all girls that are rising seniors or juniors. The application is attached to this email and is due on Wednesday, April 27th to Lauren (llutz@imsa.edu). If you have any questions, feel free to approach any BELLAs members or Lauren Lutz in 1506.

This is the last Project School Visit.

We have about 90 kids coming and need as many people as possible to give tours. This will be a busy day because leadership symposium was also rescheduled to this day. 
If you are volunteering we need you to be available sometime between 9:30am until 1:30pm. (If you can only do part of this time please email me letting me know and we'll work it out.)

If you are a sophomore sorry but you cannot give tours because you will have to attend leadership symposium.

Thanks,
Brittany Taylor

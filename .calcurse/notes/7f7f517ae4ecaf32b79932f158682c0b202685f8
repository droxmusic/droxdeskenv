We anticipate hosting
approximately 90 colleges and universities with 20 of the schools
conducting classroom presentations after the fair.

Here is a schedule for the day:

*8:00 – 9:00* Registration at the IMSA front desk and breakfast bar
provided by Sodexo (available for cash purchase outside of the Auditorium).

*9:00 – 10:00* Keynote address in the Auditorium by Kristin Tichenor,
the Senior Vice President for Enrollment and Institutional Strategy at
Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI).
We ask that parents be given preferential seating in the Auditorium and
that students interested in hearing the Keynote speaker go to D103 for a
live-feed presentation.

*10:00 – 11:30* College Fair in the Main Gym

*11:45 – 12:30* Classroom presentations I (locations are TBA)

Both presentations are repeated for your convenience.

We have placed the complete list of attending colleges as well as the
list of schools conducting classroom presentations in the Document
Library on Family Connection. Please peruse the list for specific
schools you want to visit with at the College Day.

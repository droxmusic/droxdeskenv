As you might have heard, there will be an IMSA Staff vs Students
basketball game tomorrow in the main gym. The tip time will be at 7pm. I
asked that we do our best to pack the gym, and make it one of the more
memorable moments at IMSA this year and for years to come!

There will be a concession stands for your snack and drink cravings as
well. Plus you get a chance to see some of your favorite staff and
students go head-to-head on the hardword! Come out and show your support
for students and staff game tomorrow night!!!

It will be exciting and you WON'T want to miss it! I look forward to
seeing you all there!

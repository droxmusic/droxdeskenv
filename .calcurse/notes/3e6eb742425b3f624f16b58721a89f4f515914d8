I hope you had a great weekend of cramming for APs and tests! But now you
should take a couple of minutes and think: What do I want to do after my
APs are done? Well, the answer to that should be, make a music
video!!!!!!! For those of you who STILL don't know, MMAC is hosting its
first annual vidol, or music video contest (our promotional video can be
seen here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDaBmS2bjpU). Anyway, this is a
great stress reliever after destroying those APs so sign up!

The deadline for MMAC's video contest is tonight at 11:59p.m. so make sure
you sign up! Teams can be no more than 5 people!


To enter, please send your team rooster at imsammac@gmail.com.

Thank you and enjoy the rest of your day!

Sincerely,
MMAC Board

When: Thursday May 12 from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m.
Where: West Gym
How: Tutorials at Midday on Wednesday and Thursday taught by your favorite
Patels :)

What better way to celebrate the end of APs than a fantastic Indian party?
Come join us for a garba in the West Gym on May 12th and dance away all that stress!
Don't know what a garba is?  Don't know how it's done?  No worries!  We'll have tutorials on garba-ing at midday the day before and the day of the garba, so if you're a little rusty don't miss out on a chance to get back into the swing of it.
If you've got a game that day, don't worry, the garba starts at 7 so we hope to see you there!  Feel free to go all out on the dress code; what's a garba without chaniya cholis?

Bring whatever you want to wear and send any music requests (garba music or Bollywood for later) to usheth@imsa.edu or apius@imsa.edu.

Love,
ISA

The Acronym, IMSA's official school newspaper, is looking to hire an Editorial Board for the 2011-2012 school year!
If you'd like to be considered for any of the many Acronym sections (new ones are being added too!), please fill out the attached application.
Anyone interested may apply; you do not have to have had prior experience in Acronym, though it will be preferred.

The application deadline is 8:00 p.m., Wednesday, May 18, 2011. Email the application to imsaacronym11-12@googegroups.com.
If you have any questions or concerns, please contact Andrew Ta (ata@imsa.edu) or Lucy Filipac (lfilipac@imsa.edu).

For those of you who have already started on the application using last night's student-l email, please note that there is a small error on the Acronym section editor application version sent out last night. The 5th question should ask you to select your second most-preferred section's question. A corrected version has been attached to this email. You do not need to transfer what you've already done. Just be sure to pick your second most-preferred section's question instead of your most-preferred's.

The Blood Drive is back, and here's what's going on. The Blood Drive will be on Wednesday April 13th, aka IMSAloquium practice day, from 10:00-4:30 so that everyone is on campus. To donate, you must be 16 years old with parent permission by the day of the drive, or 17 years old or older; you must also weigh 110 pounds. If you are 16 or will be 16 by April 13th, you must get your parents' permission, and there are permission slips in every person's mailbox who will need one. You will need to bring these with you to donate, not to sign up for a time.

Sign ups are going to start after spring break and be during midday; the week of signups will be the week before the drive. A few days before the drive, we need an estimate of how many donors are going to come, so it is important that you sign up ASAP. If you don't know when you're practicing an SIR presentation or don't know when you'll be free, sign up for a time anyway so that we can count you as an expected donor. If it turns out that you can't make that time, you can change your time or just come to the drive at a different time. We accept walk-ins, but we would prefer to have you signed up to have an estimate of the number of donors.

If you have any questions or concerns, email me at mbooton@imsa.edu.

Good news! IMSA's 2011-12 National Honor Society (NHS) member selection process has begun.  Attached you will find application materials as well as the rubric with which members will be selected.  Members will be chosen mid-May, and new officers will be selected shortly thereafter.

New members wishing to apply to NHS must complete the New Members Application and are required to provide two recommendations. Further detail can be found in the application itself.  Please note that you must include the recommendations at the time you turn in your application so please allow enough time for your recommenders to return the completed form to you.  Unlike other NHS chapters, grade point average and class rank are not considered in the selection process and are not a criteria for selection.

Returning members must fill out the Returning Member Application but are NOT required to provide teacher recommendations. Completion of the application does not guarantee selection.

Application materials are attached.  They are due no later than Tuesday, April 26, 2011 at 4:15 p.m and should be turned in to my assistant, Michelle Malenke,  in the President's Office.

NHS is a wonderful opportunity for IMSA students to strengthen and benefit our local communities, IMSA and themselves.   The Advisory Board -- Ms. Crowninshield, Mr. Furlong, Mr. Lundgren, Ms. Townsend -- and I look forward to working with you.

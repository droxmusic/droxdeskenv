Register now for a Book Launch and Panel Discussion!

Join us for a free dialogue and panel discussion for Quantum Physics for Poets, written by Nobel Laureate and IMSA Resident Scholar Dr. Leon Lederman and Dr. Christopher Hill, Chairman of the Department of Theoretical Physics at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory

To register for the event visit http://greatmindsbooklaunch2011.eventbrite.com/.

In the book, Lederman and Hill draw on their scientific expertise and talent to make the subject of quantum physics accessible, appealing and exciting to the general public. The book examines the historical contest of quantum physics through the eyes of Einstein and other great scientists who initially struggled to accepts its bizarre realities. In addition, Drs. Lederman and Hill also describe the diverse applications of quantum theory in its almost countless forms of modern technology throughout the world.

The Editor in Chief of Science News describes it as “a great gift to poets and all other mortals in search of an accessible yet authoritative guide to the mysterious and weird world of quantum physics.”  Drs. Lederman and Hill also are co-authors of Symmetry and the Beautiful Universe.

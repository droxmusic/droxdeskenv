Play is May 5, a Thursday evening. There is Ethics that day.

There is a spectacular new production of Peter Pan coming to Chicago in
May for 8 weeks. It features 23 actors, stunning puppets, epic music,
dazzling flying sequences and the world's first 360-degree CGI theater
set.

The venue is a 1,300-seat theater tent, which allows for performances "in
the round." The entire interior of the tent is lit with more than 15,000
square feet of high-resolution video so that both cast and audience are
immersed in a CGI Neverland. When Peter and Wendy fly to Neverland, the
audience flies with them over 400 square miles of virtual London and
beyond.

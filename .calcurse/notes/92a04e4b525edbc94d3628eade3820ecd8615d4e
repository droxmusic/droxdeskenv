Party it up at the end of Clash at StudCo's annual CotH mixer, DJ-ed by our very own Gary Sheng!
But there's a twist- This year StudCo, Amnesty, and NHS are teaming up to give you an even better reason to party! During the mixer put a handprint or write a message for peace on our banner to be hung in the Old Cafe!

This mixer is free and everyone should come, but we also encourage everyone to donate a few dollars to Pennies for Peace. By donating, you are fighting terrorist organizations such as Al Qaeda by funding education and community development in Afghanistan and Pakistan. By giving children in the Middle East an education, they are far less likely to want to join a terrorist organization.
So come, learn who won Clash of the Halls, donate a few dollars, and party the night away with DJ Gary Sheng, NHS, Amnesty, and StudCo!

Help us reach our goal of $200 for the night!

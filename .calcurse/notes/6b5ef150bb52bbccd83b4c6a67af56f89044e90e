Hey IMSA People!

Student Council will be selling the collected test preparatory books such as AP, SAT, and ACT starting during midday today, Monday, April 18 through Wednesday, April 20. All books are being sold at a discounted price.  If you want that 2400 and  36 you should invest in the test preparatory books used by your fellow IMSA students!


Thanks,

On Tuesday, April 12th at 9:00pm in the Lecture Hall there will be a mandatory informational session for those interested in pursuing the Wing Guide position. If you are interested in being a Wing Guide then stop by the meeting and get some important information on what it takes to be a Wing Guide!

Each hall, each wing, hires TWO Wing Guides to help organize wing programming, creating a sense of community within the wing and being the right hand for the RC. These students should possess excellent leadership skills, able to prioritize this position above others and be a great role model for their peers.

So, If you are interested in being a Wing Guide next year then you must attend the meeting on Tuesday night (attendance will be taken). Please be sure to sign in at the meeting so that you may receive access to the application.

The selection of Wing Guides will take place in unison with the housing process. Those selected to be Wing Guides will be notified after housing has been posted. We want your leadership, we need your leadership. Anyone interested in
being a Wing Guide or just learning more to what it takes to be one should be in the Lecture Hall at 9:00pm on Tuesday, April 12, 2011.

See you then!

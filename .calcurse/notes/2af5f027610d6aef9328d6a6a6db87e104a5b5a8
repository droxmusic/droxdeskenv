The beautiful yearbooks are finally in!! Pick it up either WEDNESDAY (May 18) from 11-1  or THURSDAY (May 19) at midday.  Make sure to bring your ID, otherwise you will not be able to pick one up.  If you want to still buy one (You should! It looks amazing!), see Dr. Scheppler in Grainger and have $75 in cash or check.

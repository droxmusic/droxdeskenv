Hey, IMSA :) 

StudCo and Peer Tutors hope you are not too stressed about projects, IMSAloquium, and of course...
APs! But don't worry! Lucky for you, StudCo Academic Committee and Peer Tutors are organizing AP STUDY SESSIONS! 
Come get help from other people taking the test and peer tutors in the subject who have taken the tests before. 

AP CHEM
7-8:30 pm: April 28th (after extended) in the MATH STUDY AREA

Hope to see you there, and good luck with your preparation!
Love love love,

StudCo Academic Committee

Are you tired of winter?     Do you have cabin fever?

Then please consider participating in our first campus cleanup of the year next Tuesday, April 12th.

We are also looking for volunteers to help in the Rain Garden as well as to help finish burning a small brush pile remaining from last fall's prairie burn.

Interested staff and students should meet at the flag pole at 4:30 pm - we will work together in teams of 3-5.

Maps, gloves, & trash bags will be provided AND so will s'mores - which we will make by our campfire!

Many thanks to Linsey Crowninshield for coordinating with students!

Thank you and hope to see you there...

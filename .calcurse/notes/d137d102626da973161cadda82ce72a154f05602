This is just a reminder that you have the opportunity to apply for a Student Representative position until MARCH 18 (this Friday!). Student Representatives are members of Student Council who voice the opinions of other students, serve on a committee, and run some awesome projects to better our school. And now that Clash of the Halls is approaching, getting involved would be a great idea if you want to participate in creating or even running some Clash of the Halls events! If you are interested in becoming a Student Representative, the application is attached to this email. Please note that to apply to become a Student Representative, you are required to have completed at least one Student Council project in one of our three committees. If you have already completed a project for Student Council, then please apply by Friday! Any applications after Friday cannot be accepted. If you have any questions, email me at cdogan@imsa.edu.  Thank you for your time, I hope you're having a good Clash of the Halls, and I hope to receive your application soon!

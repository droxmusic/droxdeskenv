Hey all!
On the 18th the IMSA Crossfire Debate club is hosting its annual trip to Loyola! We will be going to witness a trial before getting some lunch and going home. This is a great chance to get to see a real trial and wander around Chicago for a day. If you're interested, reply to this email so that we can get a general idea of how many people want to go. If you're not sure whether or not you can go, just let us know so that we can get a general idea, it is in no way binding. Priority, of course, goes to members of Crossfire Debate club, but the trip is open to all IMSA students.

Just a quick recap:
Who: Everyone!
When: May 18th, Time TBD
Where: Chicago
What: A trial and a walk around Chicago
Why: Because it will be a ton of fun!

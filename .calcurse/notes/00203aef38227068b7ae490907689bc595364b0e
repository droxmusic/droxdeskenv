It's that time of the year again! Key Club's Boys Auction will take place on April 8th. This is IMSA's largest talent show fundraiser! Boys (and men), now is your chance to help raise some money and collect tons of clothes with your masculine qualities and dazzling talents.

If you would like to be part of Boys Auction this year, sign-up in the Old Cafe
during midday on Thursday or Friday! These sign-ups will be MANDATORY or you cannot
participate. If there are any conflicts and you cannot make it, send me an
e-mail.

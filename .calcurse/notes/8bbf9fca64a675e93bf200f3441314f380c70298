Student Computing Support (SCS) is a work-service opportunity that will
empower you to troubleshoot and fix computer problems. You do not need any
experience to join, as we will teach you everything necessary to do things
such as Internet set-ups, troubleshooting, and even re-imaging!

What's more, you can earn service hours for a variety of services,
including internet set-ups, re-imaging, data recovery, writing wiki
articles, and even mandatory training!

If you have experience, great. If you do not, do not be afraid! Plenty of
people have joined SCS with little to no computer experience and have come
out extremely tech savvy. We just ask that you are committed and dedicated
to the team. Again, anyone can apply! Do not let a supposed lack of
computer skill prevent you from applying!

The hiring process for SCS begins now for the spring, and if you would like
to be considered as a possible candidate for the team, you must submit an
application. Please, take the application seriously and fill it out to the
best of your abilities.

Due to a change in when training is conducted, it is possible to be both a
SCS team member and a wing guide this year! So do not hesitate to apply if
you intend to/applied to be a wing guide.

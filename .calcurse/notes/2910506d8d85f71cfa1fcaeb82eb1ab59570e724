We hope that you all had amazing, amazing weekends! Tonight, StudCo will be hosting its committee meetings, and we want you to join us! As the year comes to an end, there are several projects we're finishing up, so come to a quick committee meeting to find out what's going on and give any new ideas you may have!

There are only two committee meetings left, so enjoy them while you can! 

Academic - 1506
Communications - 1502
Residential Life - 1505 

Hope to see you around! 

Love, love, love,
StudCo
